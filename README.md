***About Website***

This is a website that is a made up brewery that I own in Louisville.

It includes a home page, beer recipes, a weight converter for home brewing, and a form to fill out for the beer of the month club.


***Header***

Hovering the mouse over each of the navigation links with change the color of the text from white to maroon, change the padding from maroon to white, and turn mouse to pointer.

As the screen size gets smaller, the navigation links will collapse into a hamburger menu. The navigation links will reappear once the user selects the hamburger menu icon. The icon will then change to an X.

These same features are repeated across all pages. All navigation links will take you to another page except for "more info". This will lead to the footer where you can visit other pages about me since I don't actually own a brewery.


***Footer***

The footer contains copyright information as well as the direct links to github and linkedin. 

Hovering the mouse over each with change the color of the text from white to maroon, change the padding from maroon to white, and turn mouse to pointer.


***Homepage***

Contains a picture of my "brewery" and a short intro into the business. When adjusting to the mobile media querie the layout will change from row to column. The picture will update to the full width of the page and the logo will shrink. 


***Brew your own page***

Contains a picture of "my" beers. Also has a list of my favorite beer recipes and a weight converter that will allow people to make their own versions at home. When adjusting to smaller browser the rows will change to columns until the picture. 


***Beer of the month page*** 

Contains the form that can be submitted in order to join the beer of the month club.

***How I tried to complete the assignment***

1. I started by focusing on creating the website for mobile. I started with that and base items that are used for every screen size.
2. I made 3 media queries but real changes primarily take place between 2 of them. The desktop and mobile views.
3. I tried to do 3 from the css features list
	1. Used flexbox to create and change layout of header and information on my page.
	2. Created hamburger menu for mobile view.
	3. Created animation with css by making the hamburger change shape. This may be a stretch but I did create it using css by moving the bars
	used for the hamburger menu. The top and bottom bar moves back to the middle and then rotate and the middle bar becomes transparent.
4. I tried 2 from the JS features list
	1. Created form validation that adds html for errors. The name and phone number must be a certain length and the email must have @. When submitted successfully thanks the person via an alert.
	2. Created a weight converter that performs a mathematical function. 
5. I tested out the website on a couple different browsers as well as on my android phone and an iphone and everything seemed to work well.
