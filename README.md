***About Website***

This is a website that is a made up brewery that I own in Louisville.

It includes a home page, beer recipes, a weight converter for home brewing, and a form to fill out for the beer of the month club.


***Header***

Hovering the mouse over each of the navigation links with change the color of the text from white to maroon, change the padding from maroon to white, and turn mouse to pointer.

As the screen size gets smaller, the navigation links the navigation links will collapse into a hamburger menu. The navigation links will reappear once the user selects the hamburger menu icon. The icon will then change to an X.

these same features are repeated across all pages. All navigation links will take you to another page except for "more info". This will lead to the footer where you can visit other pages about me since I don't actually own a brewery.

***How I tried to complete the assignment***

-I started by focusing on creating the website for mobile. I started with that and base items that are used for every screen size.
-I made 3 media queries but huge changes primarily take place in two of them.
-I tried to do 3 from the css features list
	-Used flexbox to create and change layout
	-Created hamburger menu for mobile view
	-Created animation with css by making the hamburger change shape.
-I tried 2 from the JS features list
	-Created form validation that adds html for errors and when submitted successfully thanks the person via an alert.
	-Created a weight converter that performs a mathematical function.
